Individual-level economic models can better capture the heterogeneity of clinical severity, caregiving needs, and social context in pediatric cerebral palsy (CP). This study aimed to develop and validate prediction models estimating the impact of clinical, sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and quality-of-life (QoL) characteristics on disaggregated social and healthcare costs, and conversely, to examine how these characteristics and cost components influence QoL in pediatric CP in Spain.

This repository contains 6 R.script files containing the data and results of the article â€˜Modelling the Interplay Between Quality of Life and Societal Costs in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy: Evidence at the individual level in Spainâ€™. Each is described below:

## ðŸ“‚ Scripts incluidos

- [1. Data preparation.R](https://github.com/Diana-MND1996/Modelling-the-Interplay-Between-Quality-of-Life-and-Societal-Costs/blob/main/1.%20Data%20preparation.R):
 It contains the data previously organized and classified by variable type, preparing it for analysis and saving the final dataset for use.
- [2. Descriptive Results Table S1.R](https://github.com/Diana-MND1996/Modelling-the-Interplay-Between-Quality-of-Life-and-Societal-Costs/blob/main/2.%20Descriptive%20Results%20Table%20S1.R): This script presents the baseline characteristics of 148 individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and their caregivers. The results are disaggregated according to the presence or absence of out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditures. It generates the output for Supplementary Table S1 of the manuscript.
