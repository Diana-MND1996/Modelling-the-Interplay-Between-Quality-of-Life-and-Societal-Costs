Modelling the Interplay Between Quality of Life and Societal Costs in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy: Individual-Level Evidence from Spain

### Diana Marcela Nova DÃ­az, Paloma Arana Rivera, Sergio Aguilera Albesa, Eduardo SÃ¡nchez Iriso, Diego Rivera

Individual-level economic models can better capture the heterogeneity of clinical severity, caregiving needs, and social context in pediatric cerebral palsy (CP). This study aimed to develop and validate prediction models estimating the impact of clinical, sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and quality-of-life (QoL) characteristics on disaggregated social and healthcare costs, and conversely, to examine how these characteristics and cost components influence QoL in pediatric CP in Spain.
